# AddGPT

**AddGPT** is a PyTorch implementation of a decoder-only Transformer model implemented from scratch with minimal dependencies, inspired by the "Attention is All You Need" paper. It performs addition with 97.5% accuracy for numbers up to 10 digits, demonstrating the capability of transformer architectures to learn and execute mathematical operations without relying on traditional arithmetic algorithms.
