# AddGPT

**AddGPT** is a PyTorch implementation of a decoder-only Transformer model implemented from scratch , inspired by the "Attention is All You Need" paper, trained for doing n-digit addition 

-The model is trained with only 399k parameters and capable of performing addition between any two numbers, each up to 10 digits long, 

-Achieves accuracy of about 97.5%

-It demonstrates the capability of transformer architectures to learn and execute mathematical operations without relying on traditional arithmetic algorithms.
